THE SUMMER CHAMPAGNE STEAL: ROEDERER BRUT PREMIER
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Summer Champagne Steal
NV Roederer Brut Premier Champagne

-----------------------------------------------------------------

BACK UP THE TRUCK for Prestige Bubbles at=20
as low as $31.95

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Roederer Brut Premier is widely acknowledged to be one of the
best non-vintage Champagnes in existence - at an incredible value
for high-class bubbly from the very same Roederer of Cristal
fame.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Richard Juhlin, the Champagne guru, calls it "a Cristal-like
Champagne of outstanding finesse."

Featured in our Holiday Catalog, the response was overwhelming.
We'd sell cases, and a week later they'd be back looking for
more, spouting accolades.

We sold through our massive tranche last winter way more quickly
than we could have anticipated... so we went back and were able
to secure another parcel at the same crazy pricing.             =20
                    =20
Today we're excited to toast the upcoming holiday weekend by
presenting the official Champagne Steal of Summer: NV Roederer
Brut Premier at $35.95 a pop.=20

A bottle is good, but everyone should seriously consider a
six-pack or today's case offer, which brings bottles as low as
$31.95 each.

The Brut Premier is full of crisp, fresh orchard fruits held in
tension   with richer notes of dark minerals and a finishing wrap
of round   creaminess that bears witness to the house's
significant use of barrel-aged reserve wines in the final blend.=20
 There's a strikingly similar finesse to their prestige Cristal
cuv=C3=A9e,   along with plenty of the house's signature freshness,
elegance and   power.

Champagne under $40 is a tough category, and one that we're
always asked about, so we're thrilled that we're able to offer
such a high caliber one today - and at well below the $40 mark.
Roederer manages to turn out a wine with amazing complexity that
belies its very affordable price.=20

I've also said before, and I'll say again: The Brut Premier is a
rather rare case of an affordable, non-vintage Champagne
perfectly worthy of cellaring - so take some to stash away while
this special pricing lasts. The wine takes on a luxurious texture
in the mouth with a few years' rest, all those crisp fruits
shifting into a baseline of supporting acidity as the deeper
flavors move into luscious caramel and cream territory. Today
represents a fantastic opportunity to stock up for the rest of
the summer and beyond while pricing is as low as ever.

We should be able to confirm orders up to a case while supplies
last; if you'd like more than a case, please let us know, and
we'll do our best. To order, please reply to this email or call
the store at (212) 980-9463.

Big House, Small Mind
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Roederer is a big house that functions as a negociant-manipulant
(they buy grapes and make their own wine). But they also own 214
hectares of vines in Champagne, 127 of which are Grand Cru
vineyards.

"These vineyards," notes Liem in his profile on the house,
"account for 70 percent of the house's total needs, an
astonishingly high figure that undoubtedly contributes to the
quality and consistency of Roederer's wines." Roederer is also,
admirably, experimenting with more environmentally friendly
viticultural practices, including trials with biodynamics.

In the cellar, they've always given due attention to site
specificity, vinifying each parcel separately as well as making a
vintage cuv=C3=A9e in all but the worst years. The goal is to express
the character of the vintage and the uniqueness of different
sites, and it's a mentality that's rare, yet admirable, in
Champagne.

<p>Roederer is a big house that functions as a negociant-manipulant (they=
 buy grapes and make their own wine). But <strong>they also own 214 hecta=
res of vines in Champagne, 127 of which are Grand Cru vineyards.</strong>=
</p>
<p>&ldquo;These vineyards,&rdquo; notes Liem in his profile on the house,=
 &ldquo;account for 70 percent of the house&rsquo;s total needs, an aston=
ishingly high figure that undoubtedly contributes to the quality and cons=
istency of Roederer&rsquo;s wines.&rdquo; <strong>Roederer is also, admir=
ably, experimenting with more environmentally friendly viticultural pract=
ices,</strong> including trials with biodynamics.</p>
<p>In the cellar, <strong>they&rsquo;ve always given due attention to sit=
e specificity, vinifying each parcel separatel</strong><strong>y</strong>=
 as well as making a vintage cuv&eacute;e in all but the worst years. The=
 goal is to express the character of the vintage and the uniqueness of di=
fferent sites, and it's <strong>a mentality that's rare, yet admirable, i=
n Champagne.</strong></p>
