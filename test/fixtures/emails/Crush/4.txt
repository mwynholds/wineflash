2008 SASSICAIA: ITALY'S "FIRST GROWTH"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Original. The Only.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2008 Sassicaia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Italy's "First Growth" at the most compelling price in the
nation. =20
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When it was first released to the public in 1968, Sassicaia
sparked a revolution and spawned a riot of imitators - and thus
an entire genre of wines that came to be known as "Super
Tuscans." But NONE were - or have ever been - able to match the
awesome breed, refinement and class that Sassicaia possesses.   =20
                              =20

Today I'm excited to offer the just released 2008  Tenuta San
Guido Sassicaia, which is one of the  greatest Sassicaia releases
in the last two decades. Keep in mind that  this is after the
freak-out reviews of the 2006, which Galloni called  "simply
glorious" as well as "awesome."

Galloni hasn't yet published his  "official" verdict on the 2008
- but given the early excitement from reviewers it seems destined
for a monumental status. The classic balance, full yet silky
tannins matched to deep fruit and fresh aromatics of this 08 is
down-right intoxicating.

And when it hits, you can bet that pricing will bump up
accordingly, as it always does, with the  wider audience pushing
to get in on the action. Today's pricing at $169.95 on single
bottles is among the lowest in the nation; if you're interested
in a six-pack, we are happy to take an additional 6% off this
single-bottle price.

Sassicaia is one of the core wines I've regularly collected since
the 1985 vintage, and I deeply admire the traditional,
built-for-the-long-haul style. With its majority of Cabernet
Sauvignon (plus 15% Cab Franc), this has always, to me, been
incredibly reminiscent of a great Pauillac yet with a distinctly
Italian spirit.

Sassicaia was originally created by the Marchese Mario Incisa
della Rocchetta, a Francophile aristocrat in Tuscany. He was
passionate about wine and recognized that his home had a stony
soil (indeed, sasso means "stone" in the local dialect) that was
similar to the area in Bordeaux where his favorite wines came
from, so he planted Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and began making
wine for himself. At first, it was just for private consumption,
but in 1968 the first Sassicaia was released to the public, and a
revolution was born in the land of Sangiovese.

Sassicaia sparked plenty of "Super Tuscan" imitators (the
majority of which flaunted considerably more over-the-top
international styles), but this bottling remains coveted for both
its originality and the sheer, consistent elegance it's
maintained through the years. The greatest vintages of Sassicaia
are cellar monuments that remain vibrant, fresh and highly sought
after today - and they fetch corresponding prices. Today offers
an excellent opportunity to put bottles or cases away at the
sharpest pricing you're likely to ever see for this bottling.
