2006 SANDRONE: "UNQUALIFIED SUCCESSES" - CANNUBI BOSCHIS, LE
VIGNE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Unqualified Successes"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2006 Sandrone Barolo=20
Le Vigne and Cannubi Boschis
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Sandrone's 2006 Barolos are among the unqualified successes of
the 2006 harvest." -Antonio Galloni, Wine Advocate
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Each vintage, we become more and more impressed with the wines of
Sandrone.

Few producers are able to weave such purity and energy with such
textural elegance... and nobody does it at anything close to this
price. Yes, Giacosa's red labels are among the most seductive
wines on earth, forget about limiting the discussion to
Barolo/Barbaresco, but they also hover around $400 a bottle.=20


The 2006 Sandrones are among the wines of the vintage - I think
it's fair to say that Galloni flipped for them, but read the
reviews for yourself, they're below.

Sandrone has always been a very well respected producer in the
Piedmont, but in the last 5-10 years they have quite simply moved
to the next level. The oak has been dialed back and the
transparency and precision dialed up - few Barolos thread the
needle so finely, satiny, seductive, curvaceous... yet also
finessed, energetic.   =20

Galloni calls Sandrone's 06s "focused, driven" in style. These
are beautiful, beautiful wines.

Today we offer the estate's two 2006 Barolos: Le Vigne and
Cannubi Boschis. One, the Le Vigne, is a masterpiece of blending,
the other, Cannubi Boschis, is one of the Piedmont's most
authoritative vineyards. Both are worth having and for those who
want to crack them open, side by side on the dinner table, we
have provided special two-pack pricing. (The two-pack pricing is
also not a bad idea for those looking to cellar the best of the
Piedmont.)

It's worth noting that pricing for Sandrone's Barolos does tend
to consistently go up; very fair U.S. retailers are selling the
2004 Cannubi Boschis at $200. The 1989 (gulp) is a $500+
proposition at this point. At $245 all-in for a bottle of Le
Vigne and Cannubi Boschis, we're happy to highlight the value of
buying early. =20

The Cannubi Boschis is Sandrone's flagship wine: a single, great
site in the Barolo commune, known for its synergy of ripeness
with freshness. In line with that, Galloni calls the 06 Cannubi
"seductive, round and sweet in its ripe, dark fruit..." He ends
with an apt mention of "tons of energy and muscle" - requiring
patience. The Cannubi's aging potential should be outstanding:
two decades in the cellar, plus some.
                                   =20

The Le Vigne in this vintage should not be overlooked. This is a
blend that offers up such a  multifaceted complexity that,
certainly in 06, it puts the Le Vigne in the same general
vicinity as the Cannubi. The quality of this bottling in 2006 is
extraordinary. It's a testament to Sandrone's skills as a blender
- similar to  the great chef de caves of Champagne or, as another
example that comes  immediately to mind, Chave in Hermitage.


Our Piedmont program has become very selective over the years;
Giacosa, Conterno, Giuseppe Mascarello. These are our heroes.
Just too many tart or tannic wines use the famous name of Barolo
to get on shelves and in cellars... only to disappoint.

Sandrone is earning his place among our holy trinity; in 2006 the
wines are not to be missed.

          Antonio Galloni, Wine Advocate: "Sandrone's 2006 Barolo
Le Vigne possesses awesome balance as intricately woven layers of
aromas and flavors come together in the glass. The 2006 is an
especially powerful Le Vigne boasting a solid core of floral, red
fruits supported by firm yet elegant tannins. This, too, shows
the considerable drive and focus that is the hallmark of the
vintage. The wine's overall balance is impeccable. Le Vigne is
made from parcels in Vignane (Barolo), Conterni and Ceretta
(Monforte) and Merli (Novello). The wines are aged separately for
a year in 500-liter barrels. The final blend is assembled, after
which the wine spends an additional year in oak prior to being
bottled. Sandrone's 2006 Barolos are among the unqualified
successes of the 2006 harvest. The wines show more richness and
density than the 2005s, but less exuberance than the       2007s,
   in  a focused, driven style I find quite attractive."

Antonio Galloni, Wine Advocate: "The 2006 Barolo Cannubi Boschis
is seductive, round and sweet in its ripe dark fruit. The wine
continues to gain weight in the glass, showing a level of density
that nearly manages to cover the tannins. Floral notes add lift
on the finish. This is a powerful, linear Cannubi Boschis with
tons of energy and muscle, but it will require quite a bit of
patience. Sandrone harvests his three parcels in Cannubi Boschis
separately. Vinification takes place in stainless steel. The
wines undergo malolactic fermentation and are aged in 500-liter
barrels (roughly 20% new) for a year. Once the final blend is
assembled, the wine goes back into oak for another year prior to
being bottled in the spring. Sandrone is one of the earliest
producers to bottle, which he does to preserve as much freshness
as possible."
