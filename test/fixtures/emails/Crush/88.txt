CHAMPAGNE ON THE ROCKS? MOET ICE IMPERIAL PARTY PACK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Champagne on the Rocks?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mo=C3=ABt et Chandon Ice Imp=C3=A9rial
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Three Bottles - Six Goblets - One Ice Bucket
(Lounge Chair Not Included)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We love Champagne dearly, but frosty frozen drinks have tended to
win out over bubbles on those scorching summer days where we
can't be bothered with anything besides casual poolside (or
rooftop) sipping.=20

But this summer, Mo=C3=ABt's changing the game...=20
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Just in time for the official start of summer, and with
temperatures already soaring, Mo=C3=ABt has released a seasonal,
limited production, all-inclusive "Champagne Party Pack" that's
perfect for the summer season.

This is one-stop shopping, with everything taken care of and
smartly packaged so you don't have to worry about anything (aside
from your guest list): You get three bottles of Mo=C3=ABt Ice
Imp=C3=A9rial, six signature Mo=C3=ABt goblets and an ice bucket. Till
Monday (or a sell-out), we'll offer these very limited summer
packs (available in less than 10 retail stores nationwide) at the
special price of $179.95, the lowest price in the nation.
                                   =20

The special cuv=C3=A9e of Mo=C3=ABt Ice Imp=C3=A9rial Champagne is, quite=

literally, designed to provide icy refreshment. Developed by the
maison's own Chef de Cave Beno=C3=AEt Gouez, it's a blend of all three
Champagne grapes (Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier),
uniquely crafted to be enjoyed over ice. Before you scoff: Such
an addition would typically be an abomination (we're very serious
about our bubbles), but the ice actually works to your advantage
here.

The Ice Imp=C3=A9rial has a slightly higher dosage and intense
tropical fruit notes  - guava and mango plus fresh red berries
with a hint of exotic spice - which both relax and come through
more clearly when poured over a couple of cubes. Plus, the cooler
temperature makes for an extra bit of refreshment=E2=80=A6 and topped off=

with a simple citrus twist or fresh berries, it looks way more
elegant than that fruit-cocktail-shish-kabobbed slushy.

The set's signature glossy white goblets and ice bucket are both
neatly designed with beach and poolside regulations in mind -
they're sleek, hard plastic, so you can take them right over to
your lounge chair.

Today's offer represents the very limited retail launch of what's
already become the necessary accessory at brunches and day-night
parties in places like St. Tropez, the Hamptons and Ibiza. Though
we're not necessarily one for "hot," sceney trends, when these
sets arrived last week, I took one home over the long weekend and
was seriously impressed with how well-executed both the Champagne
and the entire package were.=20

Quantities of these Mo=C3=ABt Champagne party packs are limited,
unlike the high temperatures in the next three months' forecast.
To place your order, please reply to this email or call the store
at (212) 980-9463.
