"This is a very, very strong  vintage for this consistently
excellent estate." - John Gilman, View from the Cellar
-----------------------------------------------------------------

While there is already a lot of chatter about the obvious
challenges the 2010 German vintage presented, the fanatics who
skip this vintage are going to be very disappointed in years to
come.

The 2010 Germans are extreme - record high ripeness levels
matched to record high acidities. In many cases, this is a very
good thing.

Today we present a strong case in point with the Rieslings of one
of Germany's greatest estates: D=C3=B6nnhoff.

Helmut D=C3=B6nnhoff himself compares his 2010ers with his wines from
1998, 2001 and 2004. If you've had any of these wines then go
ahead and read into this comment all the praise it implies. All
three of these vintages were higher-acid years that produced
wines of verve and really mind-bending purity. These are great
D=C3=B6nnhoff vintages.

Only time will tell with the 2010ers but John Gilman from the
View from the Cellar penned some glowing reviews - all presented
below.

Balance was key in 2010 and few thread this needle better than
Mr. Helmut D=C3=B6nnhoff. Year in and year out, the style at D=C3=B6nnhof=
f
is one of fruit that is glowing, somehow both plush and ethereal
and always styled into something super, super fine by an acidity
that can be described as downright Baroque.=20

As profound and stupefying as these wines can be (it's my sense
that more Riesling fanatics have had their "I see God!"
experience with a bottle of D=C3=B6nnhoff than with any other
producer) the truth is that these bottles are also just downright
delicious. They are a pleasure to drink; they are fun and joyous
and, almost incidentally, they happen to be great.              =20
                   =20

A few notes on the wines below. The Leistenberg Kabinett is
always superb and we've done our best to keep the pricing as
sharp as possible, even despite the strength of the Euro and the
lower quantities available. For $23, this wine is slamming.

The Sp=C3=A4tlesen are perhaps the focal point of most U.S. consumers
- which to my palate isn't in the least bit illogical. The
Hermannsh=C3=B6hle Sp=C3=A4tlese is one of those special, special bottles=
,
every year and the Brucke is somehow both muscular and finessed.

That said, in 2010 I think someone has to make a plea for the
greatness of Auslesen. The greatest 2010 Auslesen I've tasted
have been absolutely mind-freak wines, Rieslings gone insane (in
a good way) with so much extreme tension, so much breadth and
power and electricity.

I simply have never tasted wines like this. It is impossible to
describe the experience - so buy one and taste for yourself!
(Though for those of you who want some notes, again, Gilman's are
below and he gives the Auslesen the heaviest praise and greatest
marks.) As he does every year, D=C3=B6nnhoff bottles the majority of
his Auslesen in half-bottle which makes not only the perfect
format for the intensity of the wines, but it also makes them
reasonable purchases. $40 for one of Germany's greatest sweet
wines? How much is Yquem these days?

Take a look at the list below and give us your maximum order as
soon as you can. Quantities are quite limited.

2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Oberh=C3=A4user Leistenberg Kabinett
Special Futures Price: $22.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Leistenberg Kabinett
is also a very successful example of the vintage, with a very
pronounced, citric profile that is most appealing on both the
nose and palate. The bouquet offers up a classy me=CC=81lange of
orange, pink grapefruit, slate, petrol, orange blossoms and a
beautifully crystalline expression of minerality. On the palate
the wine is medium-full, deep and very tangy, with a lovely core,
zesty acidity and excellent length and grip on the complex
finish. Very classy wine."


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Norheimer Kirschheck Sp=C3=A4tlese
Special Futures Price: $35.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Kirschheck Spa=CC=88tlese
from Helmut Do=CC=88nnhoff is a very successful example of the
vintage. The complex and vibrant nose offers up a mix of white
cherries, apples, bee pollen, a touch of sweet grapefruit,
incipient notes of petrol and a lovely base of crystalline
minerality. On the palate the wine is deep, fullish and very pure
on the attack, with snappy acids, lovely focus and impressive
length and grip on the soil-driven finish. Stylistically, this is
a bit more powerful than most vintages of Kirschheck Spa=CC=88tlese,
but is a lovely bottle in the making."


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Niederh=C3=A4user Hermannsh=C3=B6hle Sp=C3=A4tlese
Special Futures Price: $51.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Hermannsho=CC=88hle
Spa=CC=88tlese is another very beautiful example of the vintage. The
wine today offers up a stunning, crystalline expression of its
slate minerality on both the nose and palate, to go along with a
superb aromatic mix of sweet grapefruit, orange peel, incipient
notes of petrol and a topnote of orange zest. On the palate the
wine is deep, full-bodied and very pure on the attack, with a
kaleidoscopic base of minerality, snappy acids and a very long,
focused and electric finish. This wine is beautifully light on
its feet and so intensely flavored that it is almost painful to
taste today in its youth. It is a beautiful bottle of Spa=CC=88tlese
that seems likely to be a stylistic mix of the 2001 and 2004."


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Oberh=C3=A4user Br=C3=BCcke Sp=C3=A4tlese
Special Futures Price: $45.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Oberha=CC=88user Bru=CC=88ck=
e
Spa=CC=88tlese is a beautifully filigreed bottle that really shows off
this great terroir. The bouquet is deep, precise and vibrant, as
it soars from the glass in a me=CC=81lange of blood orange, pink
grapefruit, glorious minerality, citrus zest and a gentle topnote
of honeycomb. On the palate the wine is medium-full, tight and
racy, with lovely filigree, fine mid-palate depth, bright acids
and superb length and grip on the nascently complex finish. As
this wine has a pretty serious girdle of acidity at the present
time, it is entirely possible that it will prove to be even
better than my initial note."


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Hermannsh=C3=B6hle Auslese Gold-Kapsule (375ml)
Special Futures Price: $42.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Hermannsh=C3=B6hle
Auslese is also brilliant in this vintage and one of the true
superstars to be found at this Pr=C3=A4dikat level in the Nahe this
year. The hauntingly beautiful bouquet offers up a blazing blend
of blood orange, pink grapefruit, oranges, glorious minerality, a
touch of petrol, irises and orange blossoms in the upper
register. On the palate the wine is medium-full, deep and very
intensely flavored, with great focus, ripe, snappy acids,
impeccable balance and a very, very, very long and racy finish.
Just a brilliant bottle of Auslese in the making!"


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Br=C3=BCcke Auslese Gold-Kapsule (375ml)
Special Futures Price: $39.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Oberh=C3=A4user Br=C3=BCcke
Auslese is a really stunning wine in the making. The wine simply
soars from the glass in a superb aromatic m=C3=A9lange of apples,
oranges, a touch of petrol, striking minerality, honeycomb,
orange zest and citrus flowers. On the palate the wine is deep,
fullish and wonderfully filigreed, with a great core of fruit,
snappy acids, great focus and balance and stunning grip on the
very long, dancing finish. I love the interplay of soil, glazed
fruit and acids that are on display in this beautiful vintage of
Br=C3=BCcke Auslese."

 a very long, focused and electric finish. This wine is beautifully light=
 on its feet and so intensely flavored that it is almost painful to taste=
 today in its youth. It is a beautiful bottle of Spa=CC=88tlese that seem=
s likely to be a stylistic mix of the 2001 and 2004.&quot;<br />

<em>John Gilman, View from the Cellar: &quot;The 2010 Oberha=CC=88user Br=
u=CC=88cke Spa=CC=88tlese is a beautifully filigreed bottle that really s=
hows off this great terroir. The bouquet is deep, precise and vibrant, as=
 it soars from the glass in a me=CC=81lange of blood orange, pink grapefr=
uit, glorious minerality, citrus zest and a gentle topnote of honeycomb. =
On the palate the wine is medium-full, tight and racy, with lovely filigr=
ee, fine mid-palate depth, bright acids and superb length and grip on the=
 nascently complex finish. As this wine has a pretty serious girdle of ac=
idity at the present time, it is entirely possible that it will prove to =
be even better than my initial note.&quot;</em><em><br />

<em>John Gilman, View from the Cellar: &quot;The 2010 Hermannsh&ouml;hle =

to be found at this Pr&auml;dikat level in the Nahe this year. The haunti=

apefruit, oranges, glorious minerality, a touch of petrol, irises and ora=
nge blossoms in the upper register. On the palate the wine is medium-full=

 impeccable balance and a very, very, very long and racy finish. Just a b=

<em>John Gilman, View from the Cellar: &quot;The 2010 Oberh&auml;user Br&=
