2009 DAUVISSAT: "SUPERB PREMIER CRU IN THE MAKING"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Knockout Chablis"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2009 Dauvissat Chablis 1er Cru La Forest
-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS VINTAGE IS NOT TO BE DENIED CHEZ DAUVISSAT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dauvissat's 2009s are unbelievably, almost inexplicably good.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One of the more entertaining moments interviewing Raj Vaidya
(Wine Director at Restaurant Daniel in NYC) about 2008 and 2009
Burgundy was him stating, one after the other, that 2009 in
Burgundy is really a red wine vintage and then (apropos of
nothing) "Dauvissat killed it in 2009 - they are beautiful,
really beautiful wines."

To which I respond, "How is that?"

To which he responds, "I have no idea."

Fair enough - some things are just not easy to explain.

I should say that the greatness of Dauvissat's 2009s, as
inexplicable as it may be, has been confirmed by a number of
reliable, in-the-know types including, well, us.

We opened one at the store this week, not exactly doubting the
rumors but... well. Always looking for an excuse to open some
wine.                                   =20

This is an extraordinary bottle of wine in 2009, and we're ones
who normally look to Forest for value a bit more than for
quality. Just not true this year.

Dauvissat's Forest, ever the overlooked 1er Cru is sizzling in
2009. This is extraordinarily good. Stephen freaked out; Joe
called it "the greatest Clos des Briords ever made" (a reference
which is a bit too obscure to explain, but if you get it, you get
it).

The wine is pure, pure, pure, it is mineral with an invigorating
ocean breeze, a freshening green-herbal edge (thus the Muscadet
reference) - awesome dimension and depth. In fact, the ripeness
of the vintage, which in some cases can be downright flamboyant,
is here really only noticeable as a facet of dimension, of
texture and density.

However it came together, be it black magic, voodoo or simply
strict selections and thoughtful winemaking, Dauvissat's 2009s
are not to be overlooked and the Forest is one of the best values
in the 2009 stable.

Perhaps none of this should be all that shocking, as year in and
year out Vincent Dauvissat crafts what are among the greatest
wines in the entire region. Along with Raveneau, he's widely
considered to represent the pinnacle of Chablis.

Collectors of Chablis should plan on going as deep as possible
(time for that cellar renovation?) - customers who have endured
our untiring promotions for this region's greatest wines, without
succumbing, should with this bottle, succumb.=20

Try just one. Experience what the greatest of Chablis can
achieve.

Even Vincent Dauvissat himself, who is always notably humble and
candid with his thoughts on his wines and the vintages, told
Allen Meadows that although the year was quite hot and the wines
definitely have considerable richness, "I believe that they will
age much better than many people seem to be predicting at
present."

The pricing is ludicrous, or at the very least, very, very, very
good - special 6-pack pricing for those going long.

Give us you're maximum order and we'll do our best. To order,
please reply to this email or call the store at (212) 980-9463.

Tanzer: "Knockout Chablis aromas of steely minerality, crushed
stone, lemon, white flowers, fresh green vegetables and white
pepper. Wonderfully rich and generous on the palate, the sweetest
yet of these 2009s and boasting the roundness of the vintage's
best examples. The minerality returns on the back end, which
finishes with notes of silex, warm stones and licorice. Superb
premier cru in the making."


Burghound: "A notably more complex nose offers up more classic
Chablis aromas that include oyster shell, tidal pool and white
flower aromas cut with just a hint of citrus that can also be
found on the rich, generous, concentrated and quite powerful
medium plus weight flavors that evidence noticeable salinity on
the mouth coating and impressively persistent finish. Good stuff
here and worth your interest."
