2010 D=C3=96NNHOFF GRAND CRU DRY WINES: GERMAN FUTURES CONTINUE...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Grand Cru Dry Wines of Helmut D=C3=B6nnhoff
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff "Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs"
Hermannsh=C3=B6hle - Felsent=C3=BCrmchen - Dellchen
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Special German "Futures" Pricing
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"This is a very, very strong vintage for this consistently
excellent estate." - John Gilman, View from the Cellar
-----------------------------------------------------------------

D=C3=B6nnhoff is the elder statesman of the Nahe; he is also one of
Germany's greatest winemakers. In all honestly, I'm sort of
surprised Gilman only used two "verys" in describing the strength
of his 2010ers.

D=C3=B6nnhoff's Rieslings are, year in and year out, some of the most
inspiring Rieslings made in Germany; the style is deep, fruit
forward yet sparkling in clarity and purity. This is a term
that's way overused, but the wines are flawless. They are
seductive and feminine and meditative yet also mineral and
rigorous.

How's this for a line? D=C3=B6nnhoff's wines always have everything.
That's about it... but that's a lot.                            =20
     =20

Today we're thrilled to offer out D=C3=B6nnhoff's three "Grand Cru"
dry Rieslings, the "Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs" as they are called in
German. The pricing is as lean as you've come to expect from our
futures pricing.

As I've written before, 2010 in Germany is an extreme vintage -
record high ripeness levels matched to record high acidities,
meaning these wines have everything and you can taste it. (I'm
sorry, I'm still working on the vintage report... it's been a
busy week!)

D=C3=B6nnhoff's wines have a huge reputation, so I'll keep it short
today. It's a Saturday after all. But a few things are worth
considering...

First, this is a very short vintage, with quantities dramatically
down. For the moment, our 2010 allocation is about half of what
we received in 2009.

Second, while the Hermannsh=C3=B6hle is the star of the show and the
most complete wine year after year, it really is a mistake to
skip the other two vineyards. For the sake of balance, diversity,
for the sake of terroir people, we highly recommend the
three-pack purchase.=20

This gets you a discount and it gets you one bottle of each of
the Grand Crus. That's good.

As I stated last year, the Dellchen is my personal favorite - in
2009 the wine was absolutely blazing - fiercely mineral. It's
interesting to note that Gilman gives the Dellchen special praise
in 2010. The rise of a new star? We'll see...

This is it people - D=C3=B6nnhoff 2010. Unlikely to come around
again... To order, reply to this email or call the store at (212)
980-9463. Keep in mind you may not hear from us until Monday.

2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Mixed Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs Three-Pack
Special Futures Price: $174.97
1 x 2010 Dellchen GG @ $57.99

2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Dellchen Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs (Grand Cru Dry)
Special Futures Price: $59.95
Preference given to balanced orders including all of the Grosses
Gewachs!
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Dellchen Grosses
Gew=C3=A4chs is very refined and elegant this year, with the usual
power of this vineyard coming across as brilliant intensity of
flavor. The bouquet is deep and very classy, as it jumps from the
glass in a blaze of tart orange, lime, grapefruit, petrol,
crystalline minerality and orange zest. On the palate the wine is
deep, full-bodied and beautifully complex, with fine mid-palate
depth, excellent focus and balance and a very, very long, tensile
finish. This will be an extremely long-lived Dellchen Grosses
Gew=C3=A4chs."


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Felsenberg "Felsent=C3=BCrmchen" GG (Grand Cru Dry)
Special Futures Price: $58.95
Preference given to balanced orders including all of the Grosses
Gewachs!
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "The 2010 Felsenberg Grosses
Gew=C3=A4chs bottling all hails from the T=C3=BCrmchen section of the
vineyard and is excellent in this vintage. The superb bouquet
offers up scents of white cherries, sweet grapefruit, very
complex stoniness, petrol, citrus peel and a distinctly smoky
topnote. On the palate the wine is deep, full-bodied and utterly
seamless, with a rock solid core of fruit, great focus and cut,
lovely balance and excellent grip on the long and tensile finish.
In comparison to the Felsenberg Trocken, here the snappy acids
are even better integrated into the body of the wine and even
more completely buffered by dry extract. A very impressive
bottle."


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff Hermannsh=C3=B6hle GG (Grand Cru Dry)
Special Futures Price: $62.95
John Gilman, View from the Cellar: "In 2010, the Hermannsh=C3=B6hle
Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs is the top dry Riesling in the cellar, but it is
a very close race between this and the stunning Dellchen. The
deep and beautifully complex bouquet on the Hermannsh=C3=B6hle
delivers scents of pink grapefruit, lemon peel, wild yeasts,
incipient notes of petrol and a stunningly complex base of
minerality. On the palate the wine is full-bodied, tight and
tensile, with a rock solid core of fruit, laser-like focus and
great length and grip on the very mineral-driven finish. All
three of the Grosses Gew=C3=A4chs bottlings in the D=C3=B6nnhoff cellars
this year show beautiful acid integration, as the snappy acids
are seamlessly woven into the body of the wine without losing any
cut or precision on the backend. This is no small feat in 2010!"


2010 D=C3=B6nnhoff GGs are released, by law, after September 1=20
Expected arrival: Fall 2011
